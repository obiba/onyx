        This module is used to administer questionnaires. Its main features are
        <ul>
          <li>Supports many questionnaires concurrently</li>
          <li>Supports multi-language versions of the same questionnaire</li>
          <li>Questionnaires are displayed through a series of web pages. A web page contains one or more
            questions. The order of the displayed pages is driven by the order of the questions in the questionnaire.
          </li>
          <li>The display of each question may be made to depend on answers to earlier questions (skip patterns)</li>
          <li>Supports many types of questions / answers e.g. free text, single-selection, multi-selection,
            dropdown lists, boilerplates</li>
          <li>Questions sharing answer categories may be displayed in a table format</li>
          <li>Answers are validated according to unit rules and context (answers to previous questions)</li>
          <li>Answers are persisted as answered and displayed when the questions are revisited. Answers to
            revisited questions may be changed and the dependent skip patterns modified accordingly.</li>
        </ul>
