      <p>At the end of the interview, participants are given a personalized signed copy of the consent form as well as
        a copy of a report containing the results of some of the physical measurements taken such as blood pressure,
        height, etc. Eventually, this report may include interpretations based on comparisons between the observed
        results and normal values.</p>

      <p>The conclusion stage managed by the Mica module cannot be executed until all the other stages are in a
        terminal state (completed, not applicable, contraindicated or skipped). This insures that every stage of the
        interview has been taken into account.</p>
