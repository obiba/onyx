        This module is used to insure that the samples collection is not contra-indicated and that all expected samples
        have been collected by the phlebotomist.</p>
      <p>
        A list of the bar codes affixed to the tubes is maintained as they are scanned. The following attributes are
        configurable and validated when applicable:
        <ul>
          <li>Number of tubes containing the primary samples expected</li>
          <li>The format of the bar code used to identify the tubes</li>
          <li>The elements making up the bar code. They may be chosen from the following list: participant code,
            additive code and random numbers</li>
        </ul>
